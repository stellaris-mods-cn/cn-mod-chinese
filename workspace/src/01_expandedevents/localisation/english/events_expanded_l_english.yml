distar.65.akx.c:0 "What was, shall be. Their fate is out of our hands."
distar.185.mi.desc:0 "Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has made some troubling finds on [From.GetName]. The planet's megaflora is not only widespread and gargantuan in proportion, but also predatory. Various species of carnivorous plants rest patiently on its surface, releasing aromatic lures into the air and waiting for prey to come near. Sensitive tendrils on the terminus of the plant's leaves register the approach of animals, resulting in the plants snapping shut around their hapless prey, which are left to be slowly corroded by digestive acids."
distar.3001.gc.desc:0 "Caution proved well in order. Hidden inside [trojan_asteroid.GetName] was a host of old mining drones programmed to attack on sight.\n\nAutonomous Science Drone [Root.GetLeaderName] fortunately detected this early and was able to jam the drones' sensors long enough to disable them.\n\nThe drones' cores are old indeed, but retain vast amounts of energy for siphoning."
distar.3003.gc.desc:0 "The events relating to asteroid [trojan_asteroid.GetName] has attracted the attention of our central processing network on [Root.Capital.GetName]. Our research drones has reacted with curiosity, posing questions as to why the drones were originally placed inside the asteroid.\n\nWere they guarding something?"
distar.3005.gc.desc:0 "As our research network hypothesized, the drones found in asteroid [trojan_asteroid.GetName] were indeed hiding something.\n\nThe valiant efforts of the [Root.GetName]'s crew have unearthed rich mineral deposits in the asteroid's core, previously obscured by the drones' presence."

anomalymod.1.name:0 "Recovered Tomb World"
anomalymod.1.desc:0 "The unusual radiation pockets appears to be the result of an ancient nuclear bombardment that wiped out [From.GetName]'s original population. Tens of thousands of years ago, [From.GetName] would have been a near-uninhabitable tomb world. In the intervening  millennium, however, the radiation has receded to nominal levels, allowing the planet's ecosystem to recover."
anomalymod.2.name:0 "Closed Wormhole"
anomalymod.2.desc:0 "The unusual readings of [From.GetName] appear to be consistent with similar readings of naturally occuring wormholes. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has theorized that [From.GetName] was once a wormhole, but the passage to the other side has since pinched off for unknown reasons. If true, studying [From.GetName] could greatly enhance our understanding of wormhole physics."
anomalymod.3.name:0 "Black Hole Merger"
anomalymod.3.desc:0 "The black hole in the [From.GetName] system is in fact two black holes that have merged together some time in the last few thousand years, an event so energetic that it's gravitational echos can still be felt today."
anomalymod.4.name:0 "Dark Matter Discovered"
anomalymod.4.desc:0 "The unusual gravitational readings of [From.GetName] have been traced back to an abundant source of §HDark Matter§!. This exotic substance seemingly defies several known laws of physics, leading to the unusual readings measured by the [Root.GetName]."
anomalymod.5.name:0 "Robot Miners"
anomalymod.5.desc:0 "Closer scans of [From.GetName] revealed that the abandoned structures were part of a massive abandoned mining operation. Interestingly, the facility was operated entirely by heavily specialized robotic workers. The machinery is no longer operating, but it is in good enough condition that the facility could theoretically be turned back on."
anomalymod.5.a:0 "Tear it apart and study the technology"
anomalymod.5.b:0 "Power on the facility"
anomalymod.6.name:0 "Mineral Processing"
anomalymod.6.desc:0 "The derelict structures on [From.GetName] are the remnants of an ancient mineral refinery. Materials brought up from long-collapsed mines were processed here into useful minerals. The mineral veins appear to have been exhausted long ago, but we can still study the technology of the facility itself."
anomalymod.7.name:0 "Rare Ores Discovered"
anomalymod.7.desc:0 "The derelict structures on [From.GetName] are the remnants of a long abandoned mine of rare minerals. Interestingly, scans indicate that the mines are still full of these rare ores, just waiting to be dug up. Why the mines were abandoned remains unknown."
anomalymod.8.name:0 "Friendly Wildlife"
anomalymod.8.desc:0 "Investigations into [From.GetName]'s wildlife revealed that the planet was once a colony of a race of small reptilians. This now extinct civilization had systematically engineered the native wildlife to be more hospitable to their fragile biology, and the docile wildlife we see today are the descendants of a massive genetic engineering program."
anomalymod.9.name:0 "Mycorrhiza Fungus"
anomalymod.9.desc:0 "The soil of [From.GetName] is host to an abundant mycorrhiza fungus living symbiotically with the planet's plant life. This fungus is extremely efficient at extracting nuitrients from the soil, allowing plant life to thrive beyond what would normally be expected."
anomalymod.10.name:0 "Calcified Worms"
anomalymod.10.desc:0 "Soil conditions on [From.GetName] are unusually poor in nuitrients, with some areas of the planet so deficient that nothing can grow at all. The cause can be traced back to a now extinct class of annelids that once lived on [From.GetName]. These large worm-like creatures tended to calcify on death, trapping nuitrients in their stony corpses. This lead to the poor soil conditions we see today, and inevitably causing their own extinction."
anomalymod.11.name:0 "Massive Worms"
anomalymod.11.desc:0 "[From.GetName] is home to massive worms living deep in the planet's soil. While the passage of these worms can be disruptive to life on the surface, the tunnels they leave behind provide easy access to the planet's mineral deposits."
anomalymod.12.name:0 "Pitharan Moon"
anomalymod.12.desc:0 "The unusually rich soil on [From.GetName] has, strangely enough, been traced back to dust from the planet's moon, [pitharan_moon.GetName]. [pitharan_moon.GetName] contains massive deposits of Pitharan Dust, a highly potent fertilizer, within in its crust. This dust will periodically be ejected by meteorite impacts and find its way to [From.GetName]."
anomalymod.13.name:0 "A Peculiar Star"
anomalymod.13.desc:0 "Science Officer [przybylski_star_leader.GetName] thought that [przybylski_star_leader.GetSheHe] had solved the mystery of [From.GetName]. [przybylski_star_leader.GetSheHeCap] had identified the star as an Ap class star, which is known to be lower in iron and higher in heavier elements than typical stars. However, more detailed analysis revealed that [From.GetName] contains many short lived elements, such plutonium and actinium, which should have decayed into lighter elements long ago.\n\nOur scientists have struggled to explain the findings from [From.GetName], with hypotheses ranging from the presence of undiscovered, even heavier elements, to contamination by an alien civilization. Science Officer [przybylski_star_leader.GetName] has prepared a special project to test the many hypotheses that have been put forth."
anomalymod.14.desc:0 "Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has discovered that the actinide elements found in [From.From.GetName] are in fact remarkably stable isotopes. [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName] scientists have long hypothesized the existance of stable heavy isotopes, known as the 'Island of Stability,' but never before have such isotopes been observed in nature.\n\nNews of the discovery has sent shockwaves through our scientific community, and is expected to revolutionize our understanding of physics."
anomalymod.14.a.tooltip:1 "[From.From.GetName]:\n£physics  §G+9§!"
anomalymod.15.name:0 "Dissected Gateway"
anomalymod.15.desc:0 "The scattered remains above [From.GetName] are in fact remnants of a gateway that was deliberately and systematically dismantled, apparently in an attempt to learn how it functions. While the gateway is beyond all hope of repair, by establishing an orbital research facility above [From.GetName] we can get a clear picture of its inner working."
anomalymod.16.name:0 "Giant Pearls"
anomalymod.16.desc:0 "The oceans of [From.GetName] is home to several large and thriving species of shelled mollusks. These species produce iridescent stones, like some similar known lifeforms, but the pearls they produce are of an unprecedented size and quality, the largest found being almost half a meter across. If we establish a colony on [From.GetName], we could setup a pearl-harvesting operation with minimal effort."

anomalymod.22.name:0 "[lost_amoeba_fleet.GetName] the Friendly Space Amoeba"
anomalymod.22.desc:0 "It has long been a mystery why [lost_amoeba_fleet.GetName] is so friendly when her wild kin are so aggressive, but today our scientists have been able to make a breakthrough. One of our science officers noticed that [lost_amoeba_fleet.GetName] became unusually irritated when she came close to some ships testing out new prototype thrusters. The officer came to realize that the amoeba is sensitive to certain chemical's in the ship's exhaust. Even the exhaust of our standard ships contains irritants, although [lost_amoeba_fleet.GetName] appears to have developed a tolerance for them. Further investigation into this phenomena might reveal a way to pacify wild space amoebas."
anomalymod.22.a:0 "A promising discovery. Continue investigating."

anomalymod.41.name:0 "Brainslugs Revisited"
anomalymod.41.desc:0 "When the [Root.GetName] first discovered the brain slugs, we firmly rejected their offer of union. All evidence of their existance were covered up, and they became a state secret, known only to the highest levels of government. But those leaders of the past had not experience union with the brain slugs, like [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName] has. Union is not something to be feared, and our people deserve a chance to make this decision for themselves, not made for them by a fearful government."

anomalymod.61.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Worship of the Dead God"
anomalymod.61.desc:0 "Our observation outpost over §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! has noticed an unusual similarity in the local religions.\n\nIt seems that the locals have worshiped the remains of the gargantuan creature on the planet's moon as a god of death for generations beyond their remembrance. The locals believed that one day their god would rise from the dead, transforming into a deity of rebirth and ushering in a new era of prosperity for their people."
anomalymod.63.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Developing Psionics"
anomalymod.63.desc:0 "Our observation outpost over §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! has noticed an unusual development.\n\nThe local populations of [the_planet.GetName] have recently begun to develop latent psionic powers. Our researchers are still unsure of the cause, but the development seems to have coincided with an increase in psychotropic chemicals released by the dead alien creature on the planet's moon.\n\nThe locals themselves appear to have attributed their newfound abilities as a boon granted to the faithful by their god of death. This almost universal belief has significantly impacted their cultural development."
anomalymod.65.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Transcendence"
anomalymod.65.desc:0 "Our observation outpost over §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! has reported a full psionic awakening among the local population seemingly overnight, leaving our scientists puzzled at how such an event could occur so quickly. The natives of [the_planet.GetName] have fully embraced their new powers, believing this to be a sign that their god of death will soon be reborn."
anomalymod.67.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Moon Landing"
anomalymod.67.default.desc:0 "Our observation outpost over §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! has reported that the natives have managed to seend a manned mission to their moon. They chose as their landing site the corpse of the dead alien creature, which has great cultural significance to the locals. The mission was an unmitigated success, and the astronauts have made it safely back to their homeworld."
anomalymod.67.psionic.desc:0 "Our observation outpost over §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! has reported that the natives have managed to seend a manned mission to their moon. They chose as their landing site the corpse of the dead alien creature, which has great cultural significance to the locals. Strangely, when they arrived at the corpse, there was a flash of light, upon which the astronauts disappeared for several hours. Upon returning to their homeworld, there have been reports of the lunar explorers expressing previously undeveloped psionic powers, which the locals attribute as a gift from their god of death."
anomalymod.67.materialist.desc:0 "Our observation outpost over §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! has reported that the natives have managed to send a manned mission to their moon. They chose as their landing site the corpse of the dead alien creature, which has great cultural significance to the locals. Upon inspecting the corpse, they we shocked to discover that corpse was indeed just a dead alien, and not the god of death that they had believed it to be.\n\nReports of the astronauts' discovery have already spread across [the_planet.GetName]. While some have come to accept these findings, many are in denial, some going as far as to claim that the entire lunar program was an elaborate hoax."
anomalymod.68.name:0 "Angry Gods"
anomalymod.68.desc:0 "There have been reports of an alarming number of mysterious injuries and death on [Root.GetName]. There is little that connects these events, except that they tend to occur most frequently near the native population. Due to their suspicious immunity to the recent misfortunes, the local authorities have fingered them as the likely culprits."
anomalymod.68.a:0 "Crack down on this before it gets worse."
anomalymod.69.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Psionic Awakening"
anomalymod.69.desc:0 "Further reports from [Root.GetName].\n\nThe native population has undergone sudden and unexpected psionic awakening, seemingly overnight. Our scientists are at a loss to explain this sudden phenomena. The natives themselves have attributed their new powers as a boon from their god of death, to aid them in overthrowing thier oppressors - that is to say, us."
anomalymod.69.a:0 "What is going on?"
anomalymod.70.name:0 "Death God Awakens"
anomalymod.70.desc:0 "We have received a panicked report from [Root.GetName] that, while mostly incoherent nonsense, seems to indicate the belief that the dead creature on the planet's moon has stirred. While it would be easy to dismiss these reports as inane ramblings, not long afterwards we detected a massive psionic energy signature in the [Root.Solar_System.GetName] System, followed by the loss of all contact with [Root.GetName] and the surrounding systems."
anomalymod.70.a:0 "What have we done?"
anomalymod.72.name:0 "Death God Awakens"
anomalymod.72.desc:0 "We have received strange reports coming from the [the_planet.solar_system.GetName] System. Visitors to the system have reported that the dead spaceborn alien on [the_planet.GetName]'s moon has 'awoken.' Scans of the system have confirmed a high concentration of psionic energy."
anomalymod.72.a:0 "What could this mean?"

anomalymod.80.name:0 "Bunker-Bot Research"
anomalymod.80.desc:0 "Further studies into the subterranean mega-computer's database have recovered partial logs that reveal new insights into the system's function. It appears that the system's original makers had discovered an unusual gateway that was severed from the rest of the gateway network - instead, the only valid destination is an uncharted group of stars just beyond our galaxy that has been designated the §HL-Cluster§!.\n\nAccording to the database, the gateway has been deliberately locked into some kind of maintenance loop that prevents its activation. The mega-computer appears to have been programmed to find a way to abort this process and open the gate. It is unclear how the computer's current calculations are related to its original task, if at all."
anomalymod.80.a.tooltip:0 "The closest L-Gate system will be automatically surveyed"
anomalymod.81.desc:0 "The long-forgotten subterranean mega-computer on [From.From.GetName] has recently broadcasted an message to an unknown recipient, the contents of which indicate that the computer has finally finished its calculations. It appears that the mega-computer was tasked with creating an analytical model of a system composed of trillions of nanobots, with particular interest in its aggregate behavior and structural stability. Analysis of these calculations have resulted in some exciting new findings that will undoubtedly aid us in our own research.\n\nThe mega-computer itself appears to be waiting for new instructions, presumably from the unknown recipient of its broadcast, and refuses to respond to any commands from our scientists."

anomalymod.86.name:0 "Exofungus Spreads"
anomalymod.86.desc:0 "The invasive exofungus on [Root.GetName] has aggressively spread into an unpopulated section of the planet. The fungus is now firmly entrenched, and a sustained effort will be needed to burn it back and reclaim that part of [Root.GetName]."

anomalymod.91.desc:0 "The local science team on [Root.GetName] studying the primitive wetwork computer has reported a breakthrough in their understanding of the device. Through selective seeding of nutrients, they have been able to achieve limited control over the patterns of the computer's algae. Unfortunately, compiling a full translation of the computer's interface is beyond what the local scientists are equiped for, and they have requested additional scientists and equipment to further their research."
anomalymod.92.desc:0 "Our scientists on [Root.GetName] have compiled a complete user manual for the wetware computer's operating system, allowing us to interact with it as with any other computer network. Although much of the computer's memory has been corupted, we can infer that the wetware computer was an experimental network built by a relatively advanced pre-ftl race that once lived on [Root.GetName].\n\nAlthough primitive by our standards, the computer makes up for this disadvantage through its massive size, and it could prove useful in aiding our research."

anomalymod.100.desc:0 "Researchers on [Root.Capital.GetName] have eagerly anticipated the countdown of the mysterious atomic clock of prodigious precision found on [atomic_clock_planet.GetName] for the past 42 years and 3 days.\n\nSeveral decades' worth of heated speculation and conjecture have unfortunately remained unanswered. When the appointed moment arrived, nothing appeared to have occured. Further investigation revealed that the device had gotten stuck in the last several seconds of the clock's countdown."
anomalymod.100.a:0 "It will forever remain a mystery."
anomalymod.101.desc:0 "Researchers on [Root.Capital.GetName] have eagerly anticipated the countdown of the mysterious atomic clock of prodigious precision found on [atomic_clock_planet.GetName] for the past 42 years and 3 days.\n\nSeveral decades' worth of heated speculation and conjecture have evaporated in an instant: the clock has just now reached its momentous deadline, leaving behind more questions than answers. When the appointed moment finally arrived, the container began vibrating for several minutes, before falling silent. Further investigation revealed that the clock is now counting upwards."
anomalymod.101.a:0 "It was just a clock after all"
anomalymod.102.a.desc:0 "Researchers on [Root.Capital.GetName] have eagerly anticipated the countdown of the mysterious atomic clock of prodigious precision found on [atomic_clock_planet.GetName] for the past 42 years and 3 days.\n\nSeveral decades' worth of heated speculation and conjecture have evaporated in an instant: the clock has just now reached its momentous deadline, broadcasting a powerful signal directed at intergalactic space. After approximately an hour, the signal stopped, and the container collapsed into several pieces.\n\nAnalysis of the signal revealed a highly encrypted message. The content of this message, as well as the intended recipient, remains unknown."
anomalymod.102.b.desc:0 "Researchers on [Root.Capital.GetName] have eagerly anticipated the countdown of the mysterious atomic clock of prodigious precision found on [atomic_clock_planet.GetName] for the past 42 years and 3 days.\n\nSeveral decades' worth of heated speculation and conjecture have evaporated in an instant: the clock has just now reached its momentous deadline, broadcasting a powerful signal at seemingly empty space. After approximately an hour, the signal stopped, and the container collapsed into several pieces.\n\nAnalysis of the signal revealed a highly encrypted message. The content of this message, as well as the intended recipient, remains unknown."
anomalymod.102.c.desc:0 "Researchers on [Root.Capital.GetName] have eagerly anticipated the countdown of the mysterious atomic clock of prodigious precision found on [atomic_clock_planet.GetName] for the past 42 years and 3 days.\n\nSeveral decades' worth of heated speculation and conjecture have evaporated in an instant: the clock has just now reached its momentous deadline, broadcasting a powerful signal towards several remote sections of the galaxy. After approximately an hour, the signal stopped, and the container collapsed into several pieces.\n\nAnalysis of the signal revealed a highly encrypted message. The content of this message, as well as the intended recipient, remains unknown."
anomalymod.102.a:0 "What could it mean?"
anomalymod.103.desc:0 "Researchers on [Root.Capital.GetName] have eagerly anticipated the countdown of the mysterious atomic clock of prodigious precision found on [atomic_clock_planet.GetName] for the past 42 years and 3 days.\n\nSeveral decades' worth of heated speculation and conjecture have evaporated in an instant: the clock has just now reached its momentous deadline, glowing bright enough to wash out the signal from our remote sensors. When the light faded, the clock was gone, leaving faint traces of tachyon radiation in its wake."
anomalymod.103.a:0 "Where did it go?"
anomalymod.104.desc:0 "Researchers on [Root.Capital.GetName] have speculated wildly the purpose of the mysterious atomic clock of prodigious precision found on [atomic_clock_planet.GetName], and now 23 years 3 days since its discovery, we have discovered a new development. Without warning, the clock began broadcasting a message on repeat in several different languages. We are unable to understand any of these languages, but the tone of the message seems urgent."
anomalymod.104.a:0 "We must translate this message!"
anomalymod.104.b:0 "It is not important"
anomalymod.106.desc:0 "We have been able to translate one of the languages being broadcast on [atomic_clock_planet.GetName], and the contents appear to be a dire warning. According to the message, the [atomic_clock_planet.Solar_System.GetName] System is the spawning ground for a massive, aggressive spaceborn entity known as a 'Spectral Wraith.' These powerful beings roam freely among the stars, and are more than capable of destroying entire fleets. The atomic clock was apparently synched with the spawning processes of these creatures, and Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] speculates that when the countdown runs out, another of these wraiths will appear."
anomalymod.106.a:0 "We must be prepared!"
anomalymod.107.desc:0 "Researchers on [Root.Capital.GetName] have eagerly anticipated the countdown of the mysterious atomic clock of prodigious precision found on [atomic_clock_planet.GetName] for the past 42 years and 3 days.\n\nSeveral decades' worth of heated speculation and conjecture have evaporated in an instant: the clock has just now reached its momentous deadline, opening up and then... nothing. Further investigation revealed a hidden chamber that is unmistakably part of a powerful bomb: fortunately, the active substance of the bomb was removed long ago, rendering it inoperable."
anomalymod.107.a:0 "What a close call!"
anomalymod.108.desc:0 "Researchers on [Root.Capital.GetName] have eagerly anticipated the countdown of the mysterious atomic clock of prodigious precision found on [atomic_clock_planet.GetName] for the past 42 years and 3 days.\n\nSeveral decades' worth of heated speculation and conjecture have evaporated in an instant: the clock has just now reached its momentous deadline. Unfortunately, as some had feared, the clock was in fact a bomb, and then the countdown ended, a massive burst of energy rippled outward, destroying every ship and sterilizing every colony in the system."

anomalymod.109.a.tooltip:0 "Everything in the [atomic_clock_planet.Solar_System.GetName] System is obliterated. All ships and colonies within three jumps of the [atomic_clock_planet.Solar_System.GetName] System are destroyed"

anomalymod.116.name:0 "Angry Nanites"
anomalymod.116.desc:0 "Our bomb disposal unit can report with absolute confidence that the atomic clock is not a bomb. Unfortunately for Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName], that is because the clock instead contained trillions of self-replicating nanites in hidden compartments. Everyone on [atomic_clock_planet.GetName] died when the gray goo consumed the asteroid."
anomalymod.117.name:0 "Clock Diffused"
anomalymod.117.desc:0 "Our bomb disposal team has clipped every wire they could, disabling the atomic clock. Further analysis of the remains have not turned up any evidence of an explosive device of any kind, but they did reveal hidden chambers filled with self-replicating nanites. The purpose of these nanites are unknown."
anomalymod.117.a:0 "Those nanites could have been dangerous..."
anomalymod.118.desc:0 "Our bomb disposal team has clipped every wire they could, disabling the atomic clock. Further analysis of the remains have revealed a powerful explosive device concealed in a hidden compartment. If it has been allowed to detonate, it could have destroyed everything in the system, and perhaps beyond."
anomalymod.118.a:0 "It won't destroy anything now."
anomalymod.119.name:0 "The Red Wire"
anomalymod.119.desc:0 "The atomic clock on [atomic_clock_planet.GetName] was indeed the timing unit of a bomb. Unfortunately, the bomb disposal unit clipped the wrong wire, detonating the bomb early."

anomalymod.122.name:0 "It Came from Outer Space"
anomalymod.122.desc:0 "The spaceborn insects have decended on [Root.GetName], devouring every plant in sight. Our people are helpless to stop the billions of arthropods despoiling their homes. It is only a matter of time before the entire planet is consumed."
anomalymod.123.name:0 "Devastation"
anomalymod.123.desc:0 "The ravenous swarms have left [Root.GetName], leaving behind not a single leaf, straw or flower. The insects have no doubt left to find more worlds to consume, caring not for the destruction they leave in their wake."

anomalymod.124.name:0 "Spaceborn Insects"
anomalymod.124.a.desc:0 "Our sensors have detected a massive swarm of spaceborn locusts entering the [From.solar_system.GetName] System, the same planet-devouring insects that we have encountered before. Their passage through our space is an ill-omen for the [Root.GetName]."
anomalymod.124.b.desc:0 "Our sensors have detected a massive swarm of spaceborn insects entering the [From.solar_system.GetName] System, of a species we have never encountered before. These creatures should be studied to determine any potential benifit or threat to the [Root.GetName]."
anomalymod.124.a:0 "What do they want?"
anomalymod.125.desc:0 "Although they are spaceborn lifeforms, the insects that entered our system appear to prefer a plant-based died. Disturbingly, they are such voracious eaters that they could protentially strip entire planet of life, if allowed to make planetfall."
anomalymod.125.a:0 "We need to find a way to keep them off our worlds."
anomalymod.126.desc:0 "Studies of the spaceborn locusts have revealed them to be tenacious eaters and rapid breeders, and once they make planetfall, there is little that can keep them from the planet's biomass short of a complete nuclear bombardment of the planet's surface. Any planet that they are currently devouring is lost to us.\n\nFortunately, there are ways to stop the insects from reaching the surface at all. A planetary-wide shield will prevent the locusts from decending upon a planet, and eventually they will become restless and leave for greener pastures."
anomalymod.126.a:0 "We must build shield generators on our worlds."
anomalymod.126.b:0 "We must research this technology."

anomalymod.200.name:0 "Methane Biosphere"
anomalymod.200.desc:0 "Although toxic to most forms of known life, §Y[From.GetName]§! supports a thriving ecology within the high pressure of its atmosphere. Life here uses methane instead of water as a solvent, and has developed in ways that differ significantly from previously established ecological models. Its study would greatly benefit our knowledge of xeno biology."
anomalymod.201.name:0 "Aerostat Mines"
anomalymod.201.desc:0 "A ruined network of aerostat mining facilities dating back several millennia can be found in low orbit of this gas giant. It appears to have been utilized to extract rare gases from [FROM.GetName]'s atmosphere, which scans indicate are still abundant. They have been abandoned and reoccupied by many different races and pirate groups since, with the most recent occupation dating back several hundred years.\n\nDespite their advanced age, the mining facilities are in remarkably good condition, and can be occupied and repaired with minimal effort."
anomalymod.202.name:0 "Crashed Colony Ship"
anomalymod.202.desc:0 "A large colony ship plowed into the surface of this asteroid millennia ago, creating a shallow canyon. The bulk of the remains consist of cyrogenic chambers, where presumably the colonists would sleep during their ill-fated journey. There is no visible cockpit on the ship, leading our scientists to believe it was piloted through some kind of artificial intelligence.

In particular, they discovered a species of docile, brightly colored herbivores that uses gas filled sacks to gently float across the ground. These 'Gas Bags,' as they have come to be called, feed off of the native leaves and grasses, and float into the treetops to nest.\n\n Despite being slow and clumsy, the native preditors rarely hunt them. As one of the crew discovered to their misfortune, the Gas Bags tend to explode violently when their sacks are ruptured, which is enough to discourage predation. Their explosive death throws aside, Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] found that they are otherwise harmless, and are in fact quite friendly."
anomalymod.221.desc:0 "After identifying an anomaly in the gravity well of [From.GetName], the [Root.GetName] has discovered the shattered wreckage of an ancient ore superfreighter.

Its main gun alone rivals an entire [Root.Owner.GetName] fleet, and its armor is barely dented even after crashing into [From.GetName]. It shows signs of many battles, but none of the damage is severe enough to bring down such a titanic ship. Instead, it appears to have contained a flaw in its power core.

The creature is terrifying to look at, seemingly composed of nothing but teeth and claws, and ravenously devours any matter that gets too close to any of its many mouth parts. As described in field reports from the mirror universe, the Warp beast's hide forms a natural armor that is highly resistant to weapon damage, and its mouths produce a highly acidic saliva that it uses as a potent weapon.\n\nA major breakthrough was made when the beast was moved to one of our secure facilities for a sensitive experiment. After passing through the dimensional portal, it soon became less aggressive, acting with confusion and mild irritation at its new environment. Our researchers speculate that since we use hyperdrives, our universe lacks the characteristic warp signatures that woke the beasts in the mirror universe. Once we uncovered the biological mechanisms responsible for detecting subspace signatures, we were able to construct a device capable of distrupting these sensory organs, rendering the beasts temporarily disoriented. Used tactically, such a device could be devastating against Warp beast fleets. The only limitation is the massive power requirements, meaning it can only be equiped on large ships.\n\nOur counterparts in the mirror universe are delighted with our results, and have already begun constructing specially-designed ships for deployment against the Warp beasts."

Excited at the possibilities, the United Nations sponsered the Ulysses Initiative to study the wormhole, and to develop a means to traverse it.\n\nIn 2087, the Ulysses Initiative managed to send an unmanned probe to the [colony_system_2.GetName] System, transmitting back to Earth for the first time a view of an alien world. Bolstered by a wave of popular support, within two decades a half-dozen ark ships carrying a quarter million colonists each braved the wormhole in search of a new home.\n\nNone were ever heard from again. A few days after the last ark ship went through, the wormhole collapsed in on itself and disappeared, but not before spitting up half of one of the missing ark ships. This brought an end to the Ulysses Initiative, and halted FTL research until the discovery of the hyperlanes decades later.
