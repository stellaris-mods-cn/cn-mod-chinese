 tech_materials_breakthrough: "Breakthrough: Nanofabrication"
 tech_materials_breakthrough_desc: "We can make tiny tiny robots that make other tiny tiny robots. It will be adorable, and could not at all create terrifying grey goo"
 tech_industry_breakthrough: "Breakthrough: Organic Silicon Processing"
 tech_industry_breakthrough_desc: "We can harvest minerals the way plants harvest sunlight. Instead of digging for geologic leftovers, we will grow minerals directly."
 tech_rocketry_breakthrough: "Breakthrough: Inertialess Drive"
 tech_rocketry_breakthrough_desc: "Sure, for every force there is an equal and opposite reaction. But what if a localized hyperspace field could allow us to expel excess inertia into subspace, while maintaining a comfortable 1 G in transit? Yes. That makes sense. Take that, physics."
 tech_particles_breakthrough: "Breakthrough: Predictive Quantum Mechanics"
 tech_particles_breakthrough_desc: "You cannot know both a particles speed and location, but what if we just got really good at guessing one of them?"
 tech_voidcraft_breakthrough: "Breakthrough: Living Starships"
 tech_voidcraft_breakthrough_desc: "Ships will become extensions of their crew, integrated with neural circuitry, self-preservation protocols, and regenerative properties. Unfortunately, this means that ships themselves may submit discomfort complaints if you change or upgrade their components too much. Bureaucracy never ends."
 tech_field_manipulation_breakthrough: "Breakthrough: Temporal Shielding"
 tech_field_manipulation_breakthrough_desc: "Time is a far more efficient shield than any energy barrier. Small-scale temporal displacement fields will ensure that attacks cannot hit what is no longer there."
 tech_computing_breakthrough: "Breakthrough: Contained Singularity"
 tech_computing_breakthrough_desc: "Self optimizing AI does carry a risk of becoming exponentially more intelligent than its creators. But we have put this one in a very strong box, not to mention the 3 laws we hardcoded into its programming. Everything is perfectly safe, I assure you."
 tech_psionics_breakthrough: "Breakthrough: Psychohistory"
 tech_psionics_breakthrough_desc: "Individuals are erratic, but mobs are predictable. Using a combination of history, sociology, and statistics we can predict the future of entire empires."
 tech_new_worlds_breakthrough: "Breakthrough: The Final Frontier"
 tech_new_worlds_breakthrough_desc: "Standardized planning, factory produced deployable housing, and efficient management will expediate new colonies on the frontier."
 tech_biology_breakthrough: "Breakthrough: Genetic Recoding"
 tech_biology_breakthrough_desc: "Evolution is a powerful but slow process, even genetic manipulation takes a generation to take effect. Now, we can edit the entire genome of a living organism in real time."
 tech_statecraft_breakthrough: "Breakthrough: Universal Translators"
 tech_statecraft_breakthrough_desc: "Language is not only a barrier between different species, it separates various cultures within nearly every race. The universal translator has the potential to revolutionize both xeno-diplomacy and internal politics as well."
 tech_military_theory_breakthrough: "Breakthrough: Grand Strategy Simulations"
 tech_military_theory_breakthrough_desc: "By training our command staff with computer simulations from what has become known as the 4X school, our leaders will be better equipped to explore, expand, exploit, or exterminate as needed."

 breakthrough.friendly.desc: "We have good relations with the [spread_origin.GetSpeciesNamePlural], so in time we may learn their secrets through trade. Our scientists are already busy theorizing how we could adapt this new technology to our own research."
 breakthrough.hostile.desc: "The [spread_origin.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are not exactly our friends, and they are guarding their newfound technology vigilantly. Our spies are on alert for any information that may allow us to unlock these secrets for ourselves. The state department advocates a diplomatic approach, if we can get back into the good graces of the [spread_origin.GetName], perhaps they will share their innovations with us."
 spread.deteriorated.title: "[spread_origin.GetName] Classifies their Technological Secrets"
 spread.deteriorated.desc: "Our relationship with the [spread_origin.GetSpeciesNamePlural] has deteriorated, and they have expelled our scientists from their borders. If we want to understand their technology, we will have to find other means or mend the rift between our nations."
 spread.improved.title: "Science Knows No Borders"
 spread.improved.desc: "The growing friendship with the [spread_origin.GetSpeciesNamePlural] population has lead the [spread_origin.GetName] to open their research facilities to [root.GetSpeciesAdj] scientists. Soon we too will benefit from their advanced technological breakthroughs."
 spread.lost.title: "Technical Knowledge Lost"
 spread.lost.desc: "We can no longer learn the secrets of the [spread_origin.GetName]. Either we no longer share a border or they have managed to engineer their technology too enigmatically to emulate. Their advancements are likely to remain mysteries to our scientists for some time."
 breakthrough_engineering.title: "£engineering  [spread_origin.GetName] has made a Breakthrough £engineering"
 breakthrough_physics.title: "£physics  [spread_origin.GetName] has made a Breakthrough £physics"
 breakthrough_society.title: "£society  [spread_origin.GetName] has made a Breakthrough £society"
 breakthrough_unity.title: "£unity  [spread_origin.GetName] has made a Breakthrough £unity"
 
 breakthrough.materials.desc: "Nanofabrication has long been a dream of our scientists, but today [materials_origin.GetSpeciesName] researchers have made it a reality. The ability to construct molecules from the ground up, the chance to play with the very building blocks of the universe as if they were Legos, opens entirely new fields for materials technology. The admiralty believes this knowledge would allow for nearly impenetrable hull plating, and it is certain to revolutionize nearly all fields of engineering."
 breakthrough.industry.desc: "Silicon lifeforms were once a trope of early [root.GetSpeciesName] science fiction, with novels and television episodes depicting indecipherable rock-like aliens. [industry_origin.GetAdj] scientists have been able to create silicon based life in the flesh... if you can call it flesh. These creatures are essentially living, growing minerals. Instead of mining deep underground for metals and crystals, the raw materials of advanced society can simply be grown. The engineering applications of living minerals are staggering. Some claim it is to be start of a 12th industrial revolution, while others claim that this is the logical conclusion of a long history of resource exploitation, what better end could there be than to find out how to give life to and then exploit the resources themselves. And yes, now you really can have a pet rock."
 breakthrough.rocketry.desc: "The biggest limitation of sub-light space travel is not our thrust technology, but our own biology. Ships can handle far greater G-forces than the squishy beings inside them. [rocketry_origin.GetAdj] scientists have shown that a small targeted hyperspace field directly between our engines and the rest of the ship can absorb inertia, effectively reducing any amount of external acceleration to a tolerable interior G force. Apparently there is a small chance that bits of the ship and crew could also leak into hyperspace, but that is a minor price to pay for this kind speed. The test crew did return with 98% of their limbs, which is within the margin of error. This technology will surely revolutionize ship design and have far reaching applications in engineering."
 breakthrough.particles.desc: "The uncertainty principle has long fascinated amateur [root.GetSpeciesName] science enthusiasts, who have often misused it to make absurd claims about small furry animals in boxes. [particles_origin.GetAdj] researchers have announced that they can know a particles precise position, and simultaneously have a really really good guess about its speed. Predictive quantum mechanics will completely reshape our understanding of particle physics, with the first of many applications in increasing the output of fusion reactors. A [particles_origin.GetAdj] scientist explained the breakthrough this way: Imagine you have a blorg in a box. You don't know if the blorg is alive or dead, so until you look in the box it is in a state of quantum superposition, the blorg is both alive and dead. But, if we know the blorg is alive, we can guess with near certainty that the blorg wants friends. That is basically how predictive quantum mechanics works."
 breakthrough.voidcraft.desc: "Captains have spoken about their ships as if they were living beings since our ancestors were traveling in wooden ships powered by the wind. Today, old superstitions are a reality as [voidcraft_origin.GetAdj] scientists have developed prototypes of organic starships. Made out of a combination of metal and tissue, held together by synaptic circuits, these living voidcraft can sense their surroundings, avoid danger, and heal themselves from superficial injuries. They have hopes and dreams, and make their home among the stars. What new wonders in engineering will these incredible ships bring to our universe?"
 breakthrough.field_manipulation.desc: "Shields have always functioned to mitigate damage by placing either a physical or energy based barrier between the attacked and the attacker. [field_manipulation_origin.GetAdj] scientists have found a way to place that barrier not in space, but in time. While true time travel remains out of reach, temporal shielding uses small scale time displacement fields to offset incoming ordinance by a few seconds, preventing it from hitting what it was aimed at. Sadly, time displacement fields are only stable for extremely short periods, so going back in time to tell yourself to make better life choices or what the winning lottery numbers will be remains the stuff of science fiction. Nonetheless, the applications of this technology for physics research are astounding."
 breakthrough.computing.desc: "The fear that a creation will surpass the capabilities of its creator has been fodder for literature on our world since before we even knew about computing. To this day old stories of monsters being assembled out of parts of the dead or some such nonsense still inspire a cult-like following. However, [computing_origin.GetAdj] scientists have finally done it, creating a self improving intelligence that rapidly made their brightest minds seem like ants in comparison to the new singularity. Conveniently, [computing_origin.GetAdj] researchers also put that super-intelligence inside an unstable hyperspace field which they can shut down at any moment. Critics say such an all powerful being cannot be contained forever, and that eventually the intelligence will simply talk the scientists into releasing it. But such an idea is absurd, why would anyone in their right mind let a likely angry and malevolent super-intelligence out of its box? Well, until such time as it does escape, the researchers are rapidly expanding their knowledge of physics and finding new avenues of research in all fields by learning from the being."
 breakthrough.psionics.desc: "Predicting the future has long been relegated to the fringes of our society, with soothsayers and fortune tellers merely telling tales that their audience already wants to hear. However, while the future of an individual is chaotic and unpredictable, the behavior of large groups, planets, and entire empires is quite knowable, just as the path of a single molecule in a gas is chaos, we can nonetheless predict the behavior the gas as a group as it fills a container despite knowing little about the individual molecules within. [psionics_origin.GetAdj] researchers have shown that through a combination of statistics, sociology, and history they can apply this to the galaxy at large, and the larger the group, the more accurate the future they can predict. Their newfound uncanny ability to predict the future is leading to advances in all fields, and unifying their people as never before. Perhaps this is all a great act however, a few deranged [psionics_origin.GetSpeciesNamePlural] have broken free and claimed that they foresee impending doom for the entire galaxy. They have started some sort of 'Foundation' to preserve knowledge through a thousand years of darkness. They are clearly lunatics to be ignored."
 breakthrough.new_worlds.desc: "New colonies were once a wild lawless land, full of foolhardy but well meaning characters and a sense of adventure. While a romantic notion popular in books and holovids, this was never a highly efficient system for spreading to new worlds. [new_worlds_origin.GetAdj] researchers have streamlined colony protocols and tamed the frontier with the stroke of a pen and some orderly ordinances. New [new_worlds_origin.GetSpeciesName] colonies will develop at a faster rate and secure larger, self sufficient populations with ease. Each new colony can be seen as an incubator for new social structures, a vast social experiment that could revolutionize [new_worlds_origin.GetSpeciesAdj] society."
 breakthrough.biology.desc: "Genetics manipulation was once considered an ethical dilemma by early [root.GetSpeciesName] society. It would be too easy to create a permanent underclass of the genetically inferior, and conflict with genetically enhanced super-[root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] was a common trope of period science fiction. However, [biology_origin.GetAdj] scientists have discovered a way to make instant edits directly to living subjects, revolutionizing genetics, biology, and their society at large. Now evolution does not have to wait for generations to have an effect, and societal stratification is a not a concern as anyone anytime could alter their genome as they see fit. Somehow, this is not exactly a comforting thought."
 breakthrough.statecraft.desc: "In early [root.GetSpeciesAdj] science fiction, universal translators were little more than a plot device, language barriers were inconvenient to the flow of most 30 minute episodes. Yet today, [statecraft_origin.GetAdj] researchers have developed a real life portable device that can allow natural communication between anyone. With the idealistic belief that simple communication could be the last, best hope for peace, [statecraft_origin.GetName] has built a station in neutral territory to prevent future wars, a place where [statecraft_origin.GetSpeciesNamePlural] and aliens could work out their differences peacefully. Its a port of call, home away from home for diplomats, hustlers, entrepreneurs and wanderers. The name of the place is Babylon 5. Perhaps we should send an ambassador."
 breakthrough.military_theory.desc: "The lessons of history are the keys to the future. It seems that nearly every [military_theory_origin.GetSpeciesName] on [military_theory_origin.GetHomeWorldName] has become obsessed with a series of grand strategy games that depict various time periods from their history. Some cover the great wars of their past, the struggles of feudal lords to gain power when [military_theory_origin.GetSpeciesNamePlural] were still a primitive race, or more recent events like exploration and expansion into space. It seems that this fascination with history and strategy has cultivated a crop of leaders far better equipped to understand complex situations and deal with tactics and logistics to lead large fleets into battle."

 nanotech_clue.title: "L-Gates: Not Magic - New Study Finds"
 nanotech_clue.desc: "Our breakthrough in Nanofabrication has made the once mysterious gateways considerably less mysterious. Our scientists believe it won't be long before we have the ability to build and manipulate these structures ourselves. However, the gates construction seems to lack the control markers we use to keep nanites in check, it is curious how the original gate builders managed to maintain control over a swarm of self replicating nano-bots. Our scientists point out that the fact that they completed the network so long ago clearly indicates that such nanite technology is safe, surely."
